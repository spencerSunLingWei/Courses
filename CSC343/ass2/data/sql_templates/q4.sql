-- Define views for your intermediate steps here:

-- 1. Find the departured flight with each plane's capacities

create view DeparturedFlight as
select id, airline, plane
from Flight, Departure
where id = flight_id;  

create view DeparturedFlightCapacity as
select id as flight_id, DeparturedFlight.airline, tail_number, capacity_economy, capacity_business, capacity_first

from DeparturedFlightCapacity;

create view FlightCapacity as
select flight_id, airline, tail_number, sum(capacity) as total_capacity
from FlightTotalCapacity
group by flight_id, airline, tail_number;

-- 2. Find the number of booking for each departured flight

create view FlightBooking as
select count(id) as num_booking, flight_id
from Booking
where flight_id in (select id from DeparturedFlight)
group by flight_id;

-- 3. calculate and category the pencentage of booking capacity

create view CapacityBooking as
select a.flight_id, airline, tail_number, COALESCE((100 * num_booking / total_capacity), 0) as percentage
from FlightCapacity a natural left join FlightBooking b;

-- 4. keep track of the not departured flights and still not in the list

create view NotDepartured as
(select airline, tail_number
from Plane)
EXCEPT
(select airline, tail_number
from CapacityBooking);
